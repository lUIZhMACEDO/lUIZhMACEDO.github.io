                <h2>SQL</h2>
                <p>Designed and implemented a database system to manage over 20,000 data sets from Kaggle, covering every match in the Premier League era 1992-Present. (English Soccer League)</p>
                <p>I applied a datatable from kaggle that was instructed to include all the matches from the Premier League up to the current data. I addressed the challenge of counting wins, losses,
                     and draws by creating a custom function to interpret the FTR (Full Time Result) column, which only indicated H (Home win), D (Draw), and A (Away win).</p>
                <p>By making:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Home win = 1 win for home and 1 loss for away</li>
                    <li>Draw = 1 draw for both teams</li>
                    <li>Away win = loss for home team and 1 win for away team</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The database counts all of these wins, draws, and scores and organizes the data into a table to represent the teams with the best home records and best away recrods, as well as overall most wins. </p>
                <p>Created a stored procedure named UpdateTeamStats to synchronize the GoalsScored and GoalsConceded columns across the HomeTeam and AwayTeam tables, ensuring data integrity and accuracy.</p>
                <p>Implemented a database trigger named UpdateTeamStatsTrigger that automatically executes the UpdateTeamStats procedure after any insert or update operation on the relevant tables, enhancing data management.</p>
